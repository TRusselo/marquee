# Marquee

**Your media server's now-playing, as a cinematic marquee on a Google Nest Hub.**

Marquee watches Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin and casts a designed now-playing card
to your Hub the moment something plays — artwork, clear-logo, plot, ratings,
progress, a clock, even live local weather on the animated Street scene. When
playback stops, the Hub goes back to being a photo frame. Self-hosted, one
container, no accounts, no cloud.

## Why people like it

- **Seven templates** — Spotlight, Split, Hero, Lower Third, Big Clock,
  Street (a living night scene with marquee bulbs, sprayed logos, and rain,
  snow, or smoke-fog that follows your real weather), and Fanart (rotating
  fanart.tv artwork on a blank canvas — bring a free fanart.tv API key).
- **The settings page is the card.** Tap any block on the live preview and its
  controls appear — font, color, position, size, and that block's own
  settings. No wall of toggles; chips under the preview tell you exactly
  what's on the card (and go dim when a block has nothing to show).
- **Make it yours, then share it.** Every block carries its own color and font
  per template. Save presets onto the template carousel, or export a look as a
  small credited setup file a friend can import in one tap.
- **Plays fair with your household** — user and device filters, session
  rotation, and a "do not cast" content filter so the marquee never overshares.
- **Original demo art** — the preview runs on fictional demo films, so nothing
  copyrighted ships in the image.

docker run -d --name marquee --restart unless-stopped --network host \

Open `http://YOUR-SERVER-IP:8084/` for settings (a guided tour runs on first
visit). Emby/Jellyfin: pick the backend on the Connection tab, or set
`MEDIA_BACKEND` / `EMBY_HOST` / `EMBY_KEY` env vars.
